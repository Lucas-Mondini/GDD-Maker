# Godot-HSV-ColorPicker
A color wheel control for Godot which extends the built-in ColorPicker.

## Usage
To add the control to your project, you must add an instance of the scene which contains the node.  This scene is located at `/addons/HuePicker/HuePicker.tscn`.  This resource is not yet compatible with EditorPlugins, but a plugin version is hopefully coming soon.  This control *will*, however, work both in runtime projects and as an editor tool.
